- problem:      We were wondering what people could possibly use voice calls for, other than calling people.
                If you've ever travelled to a foreign country, you know your access to data and WiFi is your lifeline.
                Without it, your smartphone is nothing more than a regular cellphone.
                That's where MapHack comes in.
                MapHack will provide you directions on how to get from Point A to Point B anywhere around the world, without any access to WiFi or data.
                Unlike other offline map applications, MapHack does not require you to download any maps beforehand and will even function on a non-smart phone.

- stack:        iOS, Flask (python microframework) hosted on DigitalOcean, Designer, Google Maps API
